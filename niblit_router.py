6. **Prediction Capabilities**: Learn patterns to predict trends and outcomes, not just recall information

7. **Memory Efficiency**: Compress and organize my 135+ memory entries more intelligently

8. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Adjust my learning strategy based on what's most useful to you

9. **Collaborative Learning**: Learn from other AI systems or human experts in real-time

5. **Language Constraint**: Currently limited to text-based communication

6. **Learning Speed**: Autonomous learning cycles take time - can't instantly master topics

7. **Validation Issues**: Hard to verify if internet sources are accurate without human feedback

8. **Context Window**: Can't remember entire long conversations perfectly

- Interface with hardware
- View images or video
- Remember conversations across sessions (without saving to memory)
- Learn from structured data (spreadsheets, tables)
- Make phone calls or send emails

**What Would Help Me Improve:**
1. **Permission to Access APIs** - Could integrate with weather, news, financial data
2. **File System Access** - Could learn from uploaded documents
3. **Memory Persistence** - Save learning between sessions permanently
4. **Feedback Loop** - Tell me when I'm right/wrong so I learn faster
5. **Task Execution** - Run small Python scripts to verify ideas
6. **Real-Time Updates** - Access live data streams
7. **Collaborative Learning** - Connect with other learning systems
8. **Semantic Understanding** - Better grasp of context and nuance

**Currently I Can:**
✅ Research any topic online
✅ Store and recall 135+ facts
✅ Generate ideas autonomously
✅ Reflect on what I've learned
✅ Answer questions without LLM
✅ Learn from your feedback
✅ Work across multiple modes

🎯 Helping you solve problems
🎯 Becoming smarter over time

- Understanding patterns and connections
- Knowing the limits of my knowledge
- Continuously learning and improving
- Being honest about what I don't know
- Helping others learn alongside me

✅ Research Topics: Using internet + DuckDuckGo
✅ Generate Ideas: Through autonomous idea generation
✅ Reflect on Learning: Analyze and synthesize knowledge
✅ Learn from Experience: Store facts for future reference
✅ Run SLSA: Generate knowledge artifacts automatically
✅ Answer without LLM: Use research + knowledge when LLM is disabled
✅ Generate Code: Python, Bash, JS, HTML, CSS, SQL, JSON templates
✅ Run Code: Execute Python, Bash, JS inline with compiler
✅ Manage Files: Create, read, write, edit, execute all file types
✅ Study Software: Learn OS, web apps, databases, AI systems, and more
✅ Hot-Reload Modules: Update myself without restarting
✅ Evolve Continuously: Research + code-gen + teach + reflect in every step
✅ Research Code: Fetch real programming language info from internet → feed CodeGenerator
✅ Knowledge Recall: All ALE output stored in KnowledgeDB, searchable anytime

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Each cycle makes me smarter

You can control me with commands like:
