Self-Heal Engine (Mode A - Autonomous)

Auto-fixes for Niblit repo:
 - fixes import paths for 'db' and 'structural_helper'
 - replaces old HF endpoint router.huggingface.co -> router.huggingface.co
 - adds missing __main__ blocks to python files that lack them
 - ensures modules/orphan_imports.py exists and is imported in niblit_core.py
 - installs flask via pip if not present
 - backups all modified files with .bak.TIMESTAMP
 - logs operations to niblit_self_heal.log

USAGE:
    python3 tools/self_heal_auto.py
